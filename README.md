# serverless-tasks-api
This is a full-stack serverless To-Do List app using HTML/CSS frontend and a REST API backend on AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. Tasks can be added or deleted, with data stored in a NoSQL DynamoDB table using unique IDs. Built entirely on a serverless architecture for scalability and simplicity.
